            <p>I am currently pursuing a Graduate Master’s Degree in Robotics and Autonomous Systems (Systems Engineering) at Arizona State University. I am an aspiring Roboticist with deep rooted interest in technology and it’s impact on human society. I am always keen on learning, experimenting and discussing innovative solutions to problems and thinking of ways to solve problems using science and technology. Apart from my other hobbies and interests, I am always tinkering and experimenting with various software and hardware projects from cryptocurrency trading bots to robotic arms. I have worked on other diverse projects both as part of my academic curriculum and on my own free time.</p>
