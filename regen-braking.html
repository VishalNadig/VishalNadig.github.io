            <p>I lead a team of 4 people to design and build a regenerative braking circuit using H Bridge. Traditionally H Bridge circuits are used for bidirectional control of the motor by switching the direction of current flowing into the motor. We could build upon this concept and create a circuit that would allow the current to be controlled in both directions. The goal was to make use of a H bridge to control the direction of current flow. When the motor was powered on and the vehicle was moving forward, the current would flow from the battery to the motor. This would drain the battery and the motor would act as the load. During the braking phase, we would switch the active transistors to ensure a reverse path for the current to flow from the motor to the battery. This switching logic was programmed using an Arduino uno. </p>
