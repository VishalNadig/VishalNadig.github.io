                    <h4>Autonomous Drone Battery Swap</h4>
                    <p>I designed and 3D modelled a mechanism for the automated battery swapping in drones using Solidworks. I designed a scissor lift that could raise and lower the drone to specific slot on the platform where the charged battery could be swapped with the depleted one on the drone.</p>

                    <h4>Hand Gesture Recognition Turtlebot4 Lite</h4>
                    <p>As part of a my graduate course, I had the oppurtunity to work with a Turtlebot4 Lite. As part of the course project we were a team of two. We decided we wanted to use the Turtlebot4 as a cobot. We wanted to use hand gestures based on the American Sign Language to move and control the Turtlebot4. The Turtlebot4 platform comes with a depth camera. We could use to detect hand gestures. Hence, I wrote code for hand gesture recognition based movement of the Turtlebot4. We used Google Mediapipe python library to detect the hand gesture using specific hand landmarks that are available within the Mediapipe library. I used OpenCV and a RandomForrestClassifier AI model that we trained to recognize the hand gestures and move the Turtlebot4. The whole project was built on the ROS2 Galactic platform.</p>

                    <h4>Regenerative Braking With H-Bridge Circuit</h4>
                    <p>As an Electrical and Electronics undergraduate student I designed a circuit that was able to make use of the regenerative braking phase of a DC electric motor to charge the battery. I used an Arduino Uno as the brains of the project to control the switching logic. The circuit made use of an H-Bridge circuit to control the direction of flow of electric current between the motor and the battery.
