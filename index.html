            <h2 class="heading">About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <h3>Electrical Engineer</h3>
            <p>
                I have an Electrical and Electronics Engineering bachelor's degree in which I dove into the fascinating world of circuits, signals, and systems. I explored the principles behind electrical devices, power systems, and electronics. From studying the fundamentals of electrical circuits and electromagnetic fields to delving into digital signal processing and control systems, I was on a journey to understand the backbone of modern electrical systems.
                I got hands-on experience with designing circuits and troubleshooting electronic systems. I also spent some quality time with MATLAB, Simulink.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also worked on a final-year project, where I applied everything I've learned to solve a real-world problem. Due to my passion for renewable technology, I chose Regenerative Braking in Electric Vechicles as my final project. I was tasked to come up with the circuit design, simulation and prototyping. It was challenging but a rewarding experience.
            </p>
            <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
            <p>
            After graduating from my bachelor's degree. I was hired as a data platform engineer. My job revolved around creating and maintaining the infrastructure that handles data. I was tasked with ensuring that data flows seamlessly, securely, and efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
            First things first, I was responsible for designing and implementing data architectures. This means figuring out how to store, organize, and retrieve data in a way that makes sense for the company. It was a hybrid solution involving many different technologies to ensure seamless data flow. I'd need to choose the right tools for the job. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I was tasked with orchestrating the movement of data by building data pipelines from source to destination, making sure it happens in a timely fashion and without losing any crucial data. This involved using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) using custom scripts written in Python, SQL.
            </p>
            <p>
            Overall, it's a role that requires a mix of technical prowess, strategic thinking, and a knack for problem-solving. Plus, a healthy dose of patience for those inevitable moments when things don't go according to plan.                
            </p>
            <h3>Robotics Engineer</h3>
            <p>
            Finally, I am currently pursuing a graduate degree in Robotics and Autonomous Systems from Arizona State University. With my backgrounds in electrical engineering and software engineering, I was well suited to delve into robotics. To complement these skills, I also learned some core robotics principles. I learned the fundamental concepts of robotics, understanding the mechanics, dynamics, and control of robotic systems. This is the groundwork for everything that follows.
            </p>

            <p>
            Robot Perception: I gained experience with computer vision and sensor technologies, learning how to equip robots with the ability to perceive and interpret their environment using cameras, gyros and accelerometers.
            </p>
            <p>
            Robotics Software Development: My experience as a software engineer came in handy when it was time to learn ROS2. It is the backbone of many commercial robots and learning ROS2 complemented my software skills well.
            </p>
            <p>
            Human-Robot Interaction: It's not all about robots working in isolation. I'd be exploring how robots can seamlessly and safely interact with humans, whether in industrial settings or daily life.
            </p>
            <p>
            Robotics Research and Innovation: I gained research experience when I was involved in three research projects in three different labs where my work focused on modern control of quadrotor drones, autonomous driving cars and automated battery swapping in drones.

                <p>I have 2 years of experience as a Data Engineer at Hypersonix Inc, a Silicon Valley-based start up. I was tasked with being the architect and designer of the entire data ingestion pipeline. To achieve this, I used a mix of Python, SQL, and AWS. Python was used to automate the SQL queries and AWS Snowflake, an SQL database and AWS S3 an online storage solution were used to store the data.
