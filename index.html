            <h2 class="heading">About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <h3>Electrical Engineer</h3>
            <p>
                I have an Electrical and Electronics Engineering bachelor's degree in which I dove into the fascinating world of circuits, signals, and systems. I explored the principles behind electrical devices, power systems, and electronics. From studying the fundamentals of electrical circuits and electromagnetic fields to delving into digital signal processing and control systems, I was on a journey to understand the backbone of modern electrical systems.
                I got hands-on experience with designing circuits and troubleshooting electronic systems. I also spent some quality time with MATLAB, Simulink.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also worked on a final-year project, where I applied everything I've learned to solve a real-world problem. Due to my passion for renewable technology, I chose Regenerative Braking in Electric Vechicles as my final project. I was tasked to come up with the circuit design, simulation and prototyping. It was challenging but a rewarding experience.
            </p>
            <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
            <p>
            After graduating from my bachelor's degree. I was hired as a data platform engineer. My job revolved around creating and maintaining the infrastructure that handles data. I was tasked with ensuring that data flows seamlessly, securely, and efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
            First things first, I'd be responsible for designing and implementing data architectures. This means figuring out how to store, organize, and retrieve data in a way that makes sense for the company. It was a hybrid solution involving many different technologies to ensure seamless data flow. I'd need to choose the right tools for the job. 
            
            Then comes the fun part—building and optimizing the data pipelines. I'd be the maestro orchestrating the movement of data from source to destination, making sure it happens in a timely fashion and without losing any crucial bits. This might involve using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools, custom scripts, or a combination of both.
            
            Of course, security is a top priority. I'd be implementing measures to protect sensitive information, ensuring compliance with data regulations, and probably having nightmares about potential breaches (kidding, but not really).
            
            And let's not forget about scalability. Businesses grow, and so does the amount of data they generate. I'd need to plan for the future, making sure the data platform can handle the load without breaking a digital sweat.
            </p>
            <p>
            Overall, it's a role that requires a mix of technical prowess, strategic thinking, and a knack for problem-solving. Plus, a healthy dose of patience for those inevitable moments when things don't go according to plan.                
            </p>
            <h3>Robotics Engineer</h3>
            <p>Finally, I am currently pursuing a graduate degree in Robotics and Autonomous Systems from Arizona State University. With this I have finally achieved my dream of becoming a robotics engineer. With my backgrounds in electrical engineering and software engineering, I was well suited to delve into robotics. To complement these skills, I also learned some Core Robotics Principles. I'd be diving into the fundamental concepts of robotics, understanding the mechanics, dynamics, and control of robotic systems. This is the groundwork for everything that follows.

            Autonomous Systems: Get ready for the future because I'd be learning how to design and implement autonomous systems. This involves studying machine learning algorithms, computer vision, and sensor fusion—all the cool stuff that makes robots smart and capable of making decisions on their own.
            
            Robot Perception: Ever wondered how robots "see" the world? I'd be delving into the realm of computer vision and sensor technologies, learning how to equip robots with the ability to perceive and interpret their environment.
            
            Robotics Software Development: Writing code is my bread and butter. I'd be learning programming languages tailored for robotics, working on software architectures that make robotic systems tick.
            
            Human-Robot Interaction: It's not all about robots working in isolation. I'd be exploring how robots can seamlessly and safely interact with humans, whether in industrial settings or daily life.
            
            Robotics Research and Innovation: Brace yourself for some serious brain flexing. I'd be getting involved in research projects, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of robotics. Maybe even contributing to the next big breakthrough!
            
            Elective Specializations: Depending on my interests, I might have the chance to specialize in areas like swarm robotics, bio-inspired robotics, or even delve into the ethical and societal implications of autonomous systems.
